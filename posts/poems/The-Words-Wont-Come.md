<br/> 

The words won’t come. They hover just out of reach, like shadows that slip away the moment you try to grasp them. 

<br/> 

 I sit here, my fingers hovering over the keys- waiting for a spark, the idea, the moment when everything will click.  

<br/> 

But nothing does. 

<br/> 

The page stares back at me, empty and indifferent. It doesn’t care that I'm searching. It doesn’t care that I’m trying. 

<br/> 

It only waits. 

<br/> 

I think about every thought I’ve ever tried to capture, every sentence I’ve ever shaped, but today, the words feel hollow, an empty rattle inside my head. 

<br/> 

What am I even looking for? I don’t know what I need. 

<br/> 

A story? A sentence? A line to begin?  

<br/> 

Nothing seems right. The words dance just out of reach, mocking me, offering themselves but pulling away before I can catch them. 

<br/> 

What If I write nothing? 

<br/> 

What If I never write again? 

<br/> 

Have I forgotten how to do this? Will the words ever come back? 

<br/> 

Maybe I should stop trying. 

<br/> 
But I don’t. 

<br/> 

Instead, I sit in the silence, in the frustration, in the weight of all the things I want to say but can’t. Maybe the words are still there, buried beneath doubt, waiting to push through. 

<br/> 

Maybe they’re in the next line. 

<br/> 

Maybe they’re in the next thought. 

<br/> 

Maybe they’re in the next breath. 

<br/> 

 I don’t know yet. 

<br/> 

But for now, I’ll stay. 

<br/> 

I’ll wait. 

<br/> 

The words will come. 

<br/> 

Eventually. 

<br/> 

<br/> 

<br/>
