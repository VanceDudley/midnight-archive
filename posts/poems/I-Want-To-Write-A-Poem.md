I want to write a poem about

sitting on my bedroom floor

with all the letters you wrote me,

reading the one from our one-month

over and over

like maybe the ink will change

and tell me something new.

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about

how you rushed to put everything together—

a little bag with gifts,

notes on each one,

and how your sister wrote the card

because you were running out of time.

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about

that copy of  *Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda*

you gave me that I never read.

I wanted to,

but I couldn't.

It hurts too much.

I dont think paper should be that heavy.

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about

how you told me it wasn’t my fault.

That you didn't even know why you left. 

But I must’ve done something wrong. 

Said something wrong.

Was it too much?

Or not enough?

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about how I keep wondering— 

maybe if I had done things differently,

if I had held on a little tighter,

would there still be us?

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about

the sketchbook you gave me

that I couldn't bring myself to draw in.

I look at the blank pages

and tell myself I'll wait

until what I make is perfect.

Because anything less 

doesn't deserve to be in something

you gave me.

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about 

how I wanted to burn *BoJack* into CDs

so you could watch it in your van.

Because it's your favorite

and I couldn't afford the real box set.

But I thought maybe

you wouldn't mind.

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem

about how you said we were done

in a text

while I was at my sister's musical.

I sat there, trying not to fall apart

while everyone around me clapped.

I don't remember a single song,

just how it felt

reading those words.

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about

that time you said I smile like *Garret Watts*

and how I still think about it every day.

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about how

I wanted to draw you,

like you drew me so many times,

but being to scared to draw you imperfectly,

I instead sketched *Velma*,

because she doesn'thav to be perfect.

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about

how everything reminds me of you. 

About how every time I listen to a song, 

I wish that I could send it to you. 

About how every vanilla fragrance 

isn’t quite right without you to pair. 

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about 

the screenshot I have saved on my computer, 

labeled with just your name, 

with you saying, 

"I love you too, Vance." 

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about 

how I look at that picture every night, 

and how I wish those words 

could be written once more. 

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about 

every little thing I loved you for, 

but my life is too short, 

and the pages even shorter, 

to capture your beauty. 

<br/>
<br/>

I want to write a poem about you, 

but I can’t quite get the words right. 

And as I write what I want to say, 

I realize maybe I already kinda did. 

<br/>
<br/>

Because all I really have are these 

half-finished thoughts, 

and the things I never got to say 
 
when I had the chance. 

<br/>
<br/>

I miss you. 

<br/>
<br/>
