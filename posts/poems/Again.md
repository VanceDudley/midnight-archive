<br/> 
I reached out to you,

already wishing you were somebody else.

Already trying to shape you

for a hole you didn't fit.
<br/>
<br/> 
I laughed at all your jokes, 

built friendships and shared stories, 

but I was somewhere else — 

flipping through memories like a scrapbook, 

hoping for one of the pages to stick. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
You smiled like you didn’t know, 

and maybe you didn’t — 

maybe you thought 

I was there for you to keep. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
But every moment that you and I shared, 

was just an attempt to put back together what I lost, 

a way to pretend it hadn’t all slipped through my fingers. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
I built these moments with you 

the way a man rebuilds a house 

on broken land— 

knowing the cracks would spread, 

but still hammering the nails in anyway. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
This isn’t just to the girl who I happened to call mine. 

It’s for every girl who ever caught a little piece of me, 

every heart that thought I might be a suitable home, 

and found nothing but dust left in their hands. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
I wanted to mean it. 

I wanted to stay. 

I wanted to be someone who cared. 

But wanting doesn’t build anything real. 

And you just can’t hold onto something that was never fully there. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
You deserve someone here. 

Someone whole. 

Not someone still reaching backward 

every step. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
I’m sorry. 

I was always sorry. 

I never learned how to be anywhere 

but back there. 

 <br/>
