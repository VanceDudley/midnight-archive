<br/> 

I reached out to you,
<br/> 
  already wishing you were somebody else.
  <br/> 
  Already trying to shape you
  <br/> 
  for a hole you didn't fit.

<br/>
<br/> 

I laughed at all your jokes, 
<br/> 
 built friendships and shared stories, 
 <br/> 
 but I was somewhere else — 
 <br/> 
 flipping through memories like a scrapbook, 
 <br/> 
 hoping for one of the pages to stick. 

<br/> 
<br/> 
You smiled like you didn’t know, 
<br/> 
 and maybe you didn’t — 
 <br/> 
 maybe you thought 
 <br/> 
 I was there for you to keep. 

<br/> 
<br/> 
But every moment that you and I shared, 
<br/> 
 was just an attempt to put back together what I lost, 
 <br/> 
 a way to pretend it hadn’t all slipped through my fingers. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
I built these moments with you 
<br/> 
 the way a man rebuilds a house 
 <br/> 
 on broken land— 
 <br/> 
 knowing the cracks would spread, 
<br/> 
but still hammering the nails in anyway. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
This isn’t just to the girl who I happened to call mine. 
 <br/> 
 It’s for every girl who ever caught a little piece of me, 
 <br/> 
 every heart that thought I might be a suitable home, 
 <br/> 
 and found nothing but dust left in their hands. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
I wanted to mean it. 
 <br/> 
 I wanted to stay. 
 <br/> 
 I wanted to be someone who cared. 
 <br/> 
 But wanting doesn’t build anything real. 
 <br/> 
 And you just can’t hold onto something that was never fully there. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
You deserve someone here. 
 <br/> 
 Someone whole. 
 <br/> 
 Not someone still reaching backward 
 <br/> 
 every step. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
I’m sorry. 
<br/> 
 I was always sorry. 
 <br/> 
 I never learned how to be anywhere 
 <br/> 
 but back there. 

 <br/> 
 <br/>
